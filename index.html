                <p>I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and lived in Colorado until the age of 21. I went to college at
                    the Colorado School of Mines studying Mechanical Engineering. I then moved to Seattle and worked there
                    for six years as a nuclear engineer, but ultimately decided that engineering isn't my passion. I'm now
                    learning web development, and hope to gain enough skill to have a lifelong career as a web developer.
                </p>
                <p>I'm very interested in JavaScript, and although I'm relatively new to it, I find programming to be
                    natural and enjoyable. I hope to continue to improve my skills with JavaScript and learn more about back-end
                    web development.</p>
                <p>My favorite activities include playing video games, trying new foods, and traveling. I haven't been spending
                    a lot of time playing video games lately, but some of my favorites are the Final Fantasy series. I started
                    playing Final Fantasy 15 when it came out in 2016, but never got too far in the storyline. I hope to
                    someday pick the game back up and continue since it's one of my favorite video game series.</p>
                <p>I love trying new foods, and one of my favorite types is sushi. My favorite overall Japanese restaraunt I
                    have been to in Atlanta thus far is Ginya Izakaya. I love it there because the menu is huge and it reminds
                    me of Izakaya joints in Japan. I spent 6 months working in Japan, and would love to go back someday to
                    vacation.
