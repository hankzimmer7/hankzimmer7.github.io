                <p>I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and lived in Colorado until the age of 21. I went to college at the Colorado School of Mines studying Mechanical Engineering. I then moved to Seattle and worked there for six years as a nuclear engineer, but ultimately decided that engineering isn't my passion. I'm now learning web development.</p>
