                <p>I was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado and went to college at the Colorado School of Mines, studying Mechanical Engineering. After graduating from Mines in 2010, I moved to Seattle and worked there for six years as a nuclear engineer at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Eventually, I realized that nuclear engineering isn't my passion, and I moved to Atlanta to make a change.</p>
                <p>After exploring various options in engineering, I returned to my long-standing interest in technology and coding. I completed the Georgia Tech Full Stack Bootcamp program in September of 2018, and I am currently diving head first into finding a full-time job as a web development professional. From a kid who REALLY loved his video games to a student who showed strong skills with code, I am fairly certain I've found my calling. And, I am very excited to begin my lifelong career in this field.</p>
                <p>The Bootcamp program allowed me to gain skills for both front-end and back-end, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL, React, Express.js, and jQuery. Projects I have worked on have been rewarding (and successful), and I find programming to be natural and enjoyable. I completed the Bootcamp program with high marks, and I am continuing to improve my skills.</p>
                <p>Some of my favorite social activities include playing video games, trying new foods, and traveling. I spent 6 months working in Japan, and would love to go back someday to vacation.</p>
                <p>I welcome the opportunity to connect with friends and colleagues, old and new.</p>
